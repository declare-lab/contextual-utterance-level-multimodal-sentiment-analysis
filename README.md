# Context-Dependent Sentiment Analysis in User-Generated Videos
Code for the paper [Context-Dependent Sentiment Analysis in User-Generated Videos](http://sentic.net/context-dependent-sentiment-analysis-in-user-generated-videos.pdf) (ACL 2017).

## NOTE: Here is the updated version of the code - https://github.com/soujanyaporia/multimodal-sentiment-analysis

### Requirements
Code is written in Python (2.7) and requires Keras (2.0.6) with Theano backend.

### Description
In this paper, we propose a LSTM-based model that enables utterances to capture contextual information from their surroundings in the same video, thus aiding the classification process in multimodal sentiment analysis.

This repository contains the code for the mentioned paper. Each contextual LSTM (Figure 2 in the paper) is implemented as shown in above figure. For more details, please refer to the paper.   
Note: Unlike the paper, we haven't used an SVM on the penultimate layer. This is in effort to keep the whole network differentiable at some performance cost.

### Dataset
We provide results on the [MOSI dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06259.pdf)  
Please cite the creators 


### Preprocessing
As data is typically present in utterance format, we combine all the utterances belonging to a video using the following code

```
python create_data.py
```

Note: This will create speaker independent train and test splits 

### Running sc-lstm

Sample command:

```
python lstm.py --unimodal True
python lstm.py --unimodal False
```

Note: Keeping the unimodal flag as True (default False) shall train all unimodal lstms first (level 1 of the network mentioned in the paper)
